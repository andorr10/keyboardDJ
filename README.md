JS application to use letters on keyboard to play instrument sounds
https://andorr10.github.io/keyboardDJ/

The page loads with drum sounds already set. If you would like to switch to play the piano, all you have to do is click on the piano button.  It will switch to show you what notes correspond to what keys on the keyboard.

This application uses plain vanilla javascript.
